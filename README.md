WordPress Development Environment (WPDE) is a fantastic starting point for creating a WordPress template.

It includes responsive and accessibility design, necessary files, and features needed for proper template functioning, along with a settings page and much more.

## Demo

Check out the https://demo.github.io

## Requirements

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= v20.x.x (recommended LTS) and Package Manager installed on your computer to run these commands.

## Installation

Before running any commands, it's necessary to install the project dependencies using the following command:

* **`yarn install`** or use your preferred package manager.

## Commands

This section outlines the basic commands for working with the project. All commands are executed from the project's root directory.

* **`yarn start`**: Runs webpack to build the project. This is typically used for development.
* **`yarn format`**: Automatically formats the code in all files with the `.js`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.html`, `.md`, `.json`, `.yml`, and `.yaml` extensions using Prettier.
* **`yarn lint`**: Checks JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `src/js` directory for potential issues using ESLint.
* **`yarn dev`**: Checks CSS, SCSS, and SASS files in the `src/scss` directory for style issues using Stylelint.

## API

????????????

### Registering a new post type

Using the [post type API](https://github.com/hlashbrooke/wpde/blob/master/includes/lib/class-wpde-post-type.php) and the wrapper function from the main plugin class you can easily register new post types with one line of code.

`WPDE()->register_post_type( 'listing', __( 'Listings', 'wpde' ), __( 'Listing', 'wpde' ) );`

This will register a new post type with all the standard settings. If you would like to modify the post type settings you can use the `{$post_type}_register_args` filter. See [the WordPress codex page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type) for all available arguments.

### Registering a new taxonomy

Using the [taxonomy API](https://github.com/hlashbrooke/wpde/blob/master/includes/lib/class-wpde-taxonomy.php) and the wrapper function from the main plugin class you can easily register new taxonomies with one line of code.

`WPDE()->register_taxonomy( 'services', __( 'Services', 'wpde' ), __( 'Service', 'wpde' ), 'listing' );`

This will register a new taxonomy with all the standard settings. If you would like to modify the taxonomy settings you can use the `{$taxonomy}_register_args` filter. See [the WordPress codex page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_taxonomy) for all available arguments.
