WordPress Development Environment (WPDE) is a fantastic starting point for creating a WordPress template.
It includes responsive and accessibility design, necessary files, and features needed for proper template functioning, along with a settings page and much more.

## Demo

Check out the [demo](https://ruciloss.github.io).

## Requirements

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= v20.x.x (recommended LTS) and Package Manager installed on your computer to run these commands.

## Installation

Before running any commands, it's necessary to install the project dependencies using the following command:

* **`yarn install`** or use your preferred package manager.

## Commands

This section outlines the basic commands for working with the project. All commands are executed from the project's root directory.

* **`yarn start`**: Runs webpack to build the project. This is typically used for development.
* **`yarn format`**: Automatically formats the code in all files with the `.js`, `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.html`, `.md`, `.json`, `.yml`, and `.yaml` extensions using Prettier.
* **`yarn lint`**: Checks JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `src/js` directory for potential issues using ESLint.
* **`yarn dev`**: Checks CSS, SCSS, and SASS files in the `src/scss` directory for style issues using Stylelint.
